SEIntent Firewall App
=====================

This is a simple user firewall designed to work with [IEM](https://bitbucket.org/intentio-ex-machina/intentio-ex-machina).

Policies
--------

Most of them are pretty self explanatory. For the caller chain policy, you'll need to use logcat to look for the logged
chains. For the browser blocking policy, it's designed to only block the default AOSP browser app.
